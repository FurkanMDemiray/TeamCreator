## Architecture

In developing Team Creator app, MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel) is being use for these key reasons:

- **Separation of Concerns:**  MVVM separates the user interface from the business logic, making the code more maintainable and testable.
- **Reusability:** By isolating business logic in the ViewModel, you can reuse the same logic across different views.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** MVVM helps in managing complex UIs and business logic, leading to easier updates and improvements.
